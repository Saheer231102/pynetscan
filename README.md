PYNETSCAN
A simple python script to scan open ports of an ip address.
This works with all the ip addresses that are accessable by you.
This scirpt contains GUI [Graphical User Interface] and you can view the results in a simple format.
This scirpt takes one ip address at a time, hence does not support sub-networks scanning. 
This network scanner uses simple tcp connection techniques to get the response from the open ports.

NOTE: THIS NETWORK SCANNER IS NOT A FINAL PRODUCT AND IS NOT LOW PROFILE.
